## About me

Hi! I'm Julia, and I've been passionate about data for over 10 years, with more than 5 years in various roles ranging from **Product Owner** to **Data Scientist**. My goal has been to gain as much expertise as possible across different areas.

I have worked in **EdTech** at Inquisitive (formerly MEL Science), **FinTech** at [3commas.io](http://3commas.io/), and **BigTech** at Yandex.Search. Throughout my career, I've developed expertise in Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), A/B testing, and product thinking.

Additionally, I founded the Russian-speaking community **Analyst Girls Club** for women in analytics, which encompasses data analytics as well as systems and business analytics. In my spare time, I mentor individuals looking to enter or advance in this field.

Currently, my professional growth interests focus on enhancing my soft skills, improving my ability to sell ideas, and creating a structured approach for metric selection and A/B testing that is comprehensible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Outside of work, I study Computational Neuroscience and Bioinformatics.

I am always interested in meeting new people and finding like-minded people in different fields. So feel free to drop me a message and get to know me, or ask questions if you think I can help.
