## About me

Hi! I'm Yulia, and I've been passionate about data for over 10 years, with more than 7 years in various roles ranging from **Product Owner** to **Data Platform Engineer** and **Data Scientist**. My goal has been to gain as much expertise as possible across different areas.

I have worked in **EdTech** at Inquisitive (formerly MEL Science), **FinTech** at [3commas.io](http://3commas.io/), and **BigTech** at Yandex.Search and most recently in an early-stage startup [Emerge](https://www.emergedata.ai/), building a privacy-first data platform. Throughout my career, I've developed expertise in Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), A/B testing, and product thinking.

Additionally, I founded the Russian-speaking community **Analyst Girls Club** for women in analytics, which encompasses data analytics as well as systems and business analytics. In my spare time, I mentor individuals looking to enter or advance in this field.

My interests bridge technical depth with interdisciplinary exploration. I like understanding how signals, systems, and minds create meaning.

Outside of work, I study Computational Neuroscience and Bioinformatics.

I am always interested in meeting new people and finding like-minded people in different fields. So feel free to drop me a message and get to know me, or ask questions if you think I can help.

## Recent Work — Building a Privacy-First Data Platform
In the last six months, I architected and developed the company’s data platform using **Python**, **dbt**, **Airflow**, and **ClickHouse**. My contributions covered ingestion, transformations, storage, metadata, orchestration, and production stabilisation.

## Core Skills

- **Data & Analytics**: A/B testing design & evaluation, statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, product analytics, metrics selection, ETL development, data modelling
- **Engineering & Platform Work**: Python, SQL (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse), dbt, Airflow, API design, ingestion pipelines
- **Visualisation & Communication**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, DataLens, Metabase, insight communication for technical & non-technical audiences, writing documentation, onboarding guides, and architectural explanations
- **Soft Skills**: Research-oriented mindset, problem decomposition, systems thinking, mentoring, and knowledge sharing

# Featured Projects (in progress)

## Certifications
- **Neuromatch Academy** [certificate in computational neuroscience](https://portal.neuromatchacademy.org/certificate/2e9f4722-d167-4499-893f-d0dd69ce1198)

# Career Goals

Currently, my professional goals include:

- Creating transparent and fair methods for using large-scale data responsibly.
- Understanding how human minds work and how behaviour evolves, ideally quantified through data.
- Expanding my expertise in computational neuroscience and bioinformatics to explore the intersection of data science and human health, especially mental health.

Long-term, I aim to:

- Transition into a researcher role exploring data’s impact on mental health and genetics.
- Build scalable frameworks for analytics, making it more accessible to everyone.
- Mentor and support aspiring data analysts through educational initiatives.
